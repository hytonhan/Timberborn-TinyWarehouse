# Timberborn-TinyWarehouse
Adds a compact 1x1 tiny warehouse with a capacity of 25 items to Timberborn. It can be built for a small cost of 5 logs. 

This works with game version v0.2.1.0, which at the moment of writing is the experimental branch.

# Usage
Download and install the mod in your preferred way. Then the mod is good to go. the tiny warehouse is added to the Storage tab

# Installing
Recommended way to install this mod is through [Thunderstore](https://timberborn.thunderstore.io/). You can install this plugin manually by cloning the repo, building it
and adding the dll to your bepinex plugins folder. This plugin is dependent on the magnificent [TimberAPI](https://github.com/Timberborn-Modding-Central/TimberAPI).

# About assets
As of now my github repo does not contain the model files of the warehouse. It only has the assetbundle, which doesn't really allow for 
altering the tiny warehouse's model. /shrug the tiny warehouseis basically just the small warehouse but shrinked. It can be done in Unity.
